### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**lskatz/lskatz** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a bioinformatician in the Enteric Diseases Laboratory Branch at CDC.

- I speak :camel: perl, :gear: rust, and :dolphin: SQL
- I pretend to speak :roll_eyes: R and :snake: Python.
- :dizzy_face: In my past lives, I used to code PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and even some C.

I have worked on some perl modules including `Bio::Kmer` but also more complete packages such as Mashtree and Lyve-SET.
I have more in my repos and would be glad to collaborate with you!
